Hello I'm Afia!.
I'm thrilled to be a first-year Computer Science student at Air University, ready to dive into the dynamic realm of technology.
My passion lies in constantly expanding my skill set, and I'm actively seeking opportunities for courses, certifications, and internships.
Currently, I'm immersing myself in C/C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a keen interest in mastering data structures and algorithms. 
My goal is to not only deepen my technical expertise but also establish valuable connections within the tech industry.
